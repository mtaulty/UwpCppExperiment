These are a set of projects which go hand in hand with a blog post that I put together [over here](https://mtaulty.com/2019/03/22/rough-notes-on-experiments-with-uwp-apis-in-the-unity-editor-with-c-winrt/) which is a very rough set of notes around my experiments in using C++/WinRT inside of Unity in order to implement the pieces of functionality in a HoloLens app that require UWP API calls.

See the blog post [over here](https://mtaulty.com/?p=17039) for more (much more) detail on what this was intended to be about at the time that I put the repo here.

There are three projects here and they all have their own short readme's.

* Unity Project [readme](UnityProject/readme.md)
* Native Plugin Project [readme](NativeCodeProject/readme.md)
* Dummy Wpf Desktop Bridge Packaging Project [readme](DummyDesktopBridgeProject/readme.md)

This is purely experimental stuff (for me - you might have all of this cracked already) so apply a pinch of salt.
